        <h1>Our Story</h1>

        <p>
            Belle loved reading books since she was young. She attended her local library weekly reading sessions,
            started a book club with her friends and even set out a library box outside her house for her community
            to share her books. Belle knew she one day would want to open her very own book store as her collection
            of books grew greatly over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Belle worked at her university bookstore as a grad student. Becoming a Librarian was her educational goal
            but in 2013 an she opened her bookstore. The opportunity came when the previous own was planning to retire
            but was waiting to find the suitable fit. Belle visited this same bookstore quite often for the past 15 years.
            So one when Belle walked in, the owner asked Belle if she was interested in taking over. She was delighted over
            this opportunity and the rest was history.

            Belle's bookstore hosts author readings, book clubs, author book signing events
            and more!
